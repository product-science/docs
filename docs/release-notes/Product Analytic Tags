This feature allows engineers to see product analytics and custom performance metrics in traces. Got a signal from your APM that screen 
loading time took longer? With this feature, you will be able to easily find the exact location on a timeline and see the root cause of the 
issues on the trace.

After the setup, traces will be automatically annotated with product metrics (displayed as grey flags) and placed on the timeline by PS Tool. 
This replaces the repeated effort required to locate and annotate each product metric for every new trace recorded, while also ensuring that 
no business-important metrics are left behind.This streamlines the identification of performance metrics and allows engineers to focus on 
root-cause analysis.
