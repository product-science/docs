# R1.8 - Support of Swift 6, Xcode 16, and custom clone paths

We are happy to introduce an update to the iOS version of PS Tool. 

**This latest version of `PSCliCodeInjector` supports Swift 6 and Xcode 16.**

## What else is new?

 The latest version also adds support for the `-clonedSourcePackagesDirPath` and `-derivedDataPath` flags. These flags are passed to all `xcodebuild` commands, including those handling Swift Package Manager (SPM) dependencies, ensuring consistent directories for local dependencies and build caches between standard and PS builds when it's possible. 

 This enhancement aligns with `xcodebuild` functionality, allowing you to specify custom paths for cloned source packages and derived data, thus maintaining a consistent build environment across different build types.

## How to implement?

You can supply these flags in two ways:

- **Within the** `-console-build-command`: Include the flags in your console build command.
- **As direct parameters to** `PSCliCodeInjector`: Pass the flags directly when invoking `PSCliCodeInjector`.
