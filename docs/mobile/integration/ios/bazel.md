# iOS Build Instructions - Bazel

The following instructions describe how to add Product Science instrumentation to a [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) project's iOS application.

!!! example

    Several of this document's steps include an "Example" section that describes how to apply the instructions to a demo Bazel application named SimpleApp. If you'd like to follow along, just clone our [demoapps repository](https://github.com/product-science/demoapps):

    ```shell
    % cd ~
    % git clone https://github.com/product-science/demoapps
    ```

    Our examples will assume that you've cloned the repository to your home directory and kept the repository's default directory name (`demoapps`). If you decide to change either of these details, then modify the specified paths to fit your setup.

## 1. Copy `productscience.yaml` to your project's workspace directory

_NOTE: If your build environment does not allow network access, then you will be provided with a 'productscience.zip' archive instead of a .yaml file. Copy the entire .zip archive to your workspace directory (do not unzip the archive)._

Product Science will provide you with a `productscience.yaml` file that contains your credentials and configuration details.

!!! info

    If you haven't received this file or need to request a new copy, please reach out to your designated integration support contact via established communication channel. If this contact is unavailable, send an email to support@productscience.ai for assistance.

Once you've received your `productscience.yaml` file, copy the file to your project's [workspace](https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#workspace) directory (next to the `WORKSPACE` file).

??? example

    Assuming you've downloaded `productscience.yaml` to your `~/Downloads` directory:

    ```shell
    % cp ~/Downloads/productscience.yaml ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel

    % ls -go ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel
    ...
    -rw-r--r--  1    819 May 11 2023 WORKSPACE
    -rw-r--r--  1   3619 May 12 2023 productscience.yaml
    ...
    ```

## 2. Install `buildozer`

[`buildozer`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/master/buildozer/README.md) is a build tool created and maintained by the Bazel team to rewrite `BUILD` files. `PSCliCodeInjector` uses this tool to configure your
project's `BUILD` files during injection.

Before running `PSCliCodeInjector` for the first time, you'll need to install `buildozer` on the host computer.
Instructions for installation can be found on the project's [repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildozer).

## 3. Install `PSCliCodeInjector`

_NOTE: Offline builds are not hosted on our public repo. If your build environment does not allow network access, PS will work with your team to share offline-compatible builds via a private channel._

Download the latest installer package (named `PSCliCodeInjector.pkg`) from our [public plugin repo](https://github.com/product-science/PSios/releases).

Double-click the downloaded `.pkg` to start the installation process. By default, `PSCliCodeInjector` will be installed to `/usr/local/bin`.

## 4. Run `PSCliCodeInjector`

`PSCliCodeInjector` adds Product Science's instrumentation to your project's source code.

Before any changes are made to your project, `PSCliCodeInjector` will create a copy of your project's directory and save it to a backup location. `PSCliCodeInjector` will then add Product Science's instrumentation to your workspace directory's source code. The backup directory will contain the original, un-instrumented code.

!!! warning "Important"
    When you want to create an instrumented build, be sure to use the original project directory and not the backup directory.

!!! warning "Important"
    The code changes made by `PSCliCodeInjector` result in a large number of compile-time warnings, which can cause build failure if Bazel's max stdout/stderr log size is exceeded. To prevent this, include the following option in your `bazel build` command:
    ```
    --experimental_ui_max_stdouterr_bytes=-1
    ```

### Basic use

```shell
PSCliCodeInjector <root-directory> \
  --console-build-command "<console-build-command>"
```

There are only two required parameters when running `PSCliCodeInjector`:

1. `root-directory`: This is the path to your project's [workspace](https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#workspace) directory. There must be a Bazel `WORKSPACE` file at the top level of this directory.
2. `console-build-command`: This is the build command that the tool will use to confirm that your project compiles successfully before and after injection. This command will be run from your project's workspace directory.

??? example

      Assuming that you've cloned the demoapps repository to `~/demoapps`, the full path to your `root-directory` (aka your workspace directory) will be `~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel`.

      Product Science does not currently support the iOS Simulator as a run destination, so the app will need to be built for device. To build for device, you'll first need to configure the app's code-siging settings. Perform the following steps:

      1. Copy a valid provisioning profile to `~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/configuration/`. Rename the provisioning profile to `SimpleApp.mobileprovision`.
      2. Run the following command, replacing `<YOUR_BUNDLE_ID>` with a bundle identifier that will work with your copied provisioning profile.

      ```shell
      echo "BUNDLE_ID = \"<YOUR_BUNDLE_ID>\"" >> ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/configuration/codesign.bzl
      ```

      Once that's done, the following will be your `console-build-command`:
      ```bazel
      bazel build //ios-app:SimpleApp --ios_multi_cpus=arm64
      ```

      Given the information above, your full `PSCliCodeInjector` command will be:

      ```shell
      % PSCliCodeInjector ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel \
          --console-build-command="bazel build //ios-app:SimpleApp --ios_multi_cpus=arm64"
      ```

      Run this command and wait for the tool to finish its work. When done, several of the files inside `~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel` will have uncommitted changes. You can see an overview of the changes using git:

      ```shell
      % git -C ~/demoapps status
      On branch main
      Changes not staged for commit:
        (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	            modified:   iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/BUILD
	            modified:   iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/SimpleApp/AppDelegate.swift
	            modified:   iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/SimpleApp/FirstViewController.swift
	            modified:   iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/SimpleApp/SceneDelegate.swift
	            modified:   iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/SimpleApp/SecondViewController.swift

      Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
              iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel-BACKUP/
              iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/PSKit/
              iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/productscience.yaml

      no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
      ```

      Five existing files have been modified. There are also three untracked items - the `productscience.yaml` file that you added earlier, along with two new directories:

      - `iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel-BACKUP/` is a snapshot of `iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/`, created before any changes are made to the contents of `iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/`. By default, the backup directory is named `<root-directory>-BACKUP` and added as a sibling directory of the original. You can change this behavior using the `--backup-dir` option (see ["Changing the backup directory"](#changing-the-backup-directory) below).
      - `iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/PSKit/` is Product Science's framework package, responsible for tracing the app's code. An example of its use can be found in`iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ios-app/BUILD`, where it is added as a dependency of SimpleAppLib.

      At this point, you should be able to install the app to your iOS device and record a trace.

      To install the app:

      The .ipa can be found at `~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/bazel-out/applebin_ios-ios_arm64-fastbuild-ST-9204ac8255b1/bin/ios-app/SimpleApp.ipa`. If you have [ios-deploy](https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy#installation) on your host computer, you can install this .ipa to your device from the command line:

      ```shell
      % ios-deploy --bundle ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/bazel-out/applebin_ios-ios_arm64-fastbuild-ST-9204ac8255b1/bin/ios-app/SimpleApp.ipa
      ```

      If you'd prefer, you can also install the app from Xcode's ["Devices and Simulators"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device#Configure-the-list-of-simulated-devices) window.

      To record a trace:

      ![type:video](../../video/ios-recording_trace-480.mp4)

### Changing the backup directory

```shell
PSCliCodeInjector <root-directory> \
  --console-build-command "<console-build-command>" \
  --backup-dir <backup-directory>
```

A backup of your project's root directory will be created before injection is run. By default, this backup directory is created at  `<root-directory>-BACKUP`.

You can override the location of the backup directory by including the `--backup-dir` option with a custom directory path.

??? example

      You're about to re-run injection on the SimpleApp-Bazel workspace, and `PSCliCodeInjector` doesn't currently support modifications to already-injected code. Before continuing, revert the changes from previous examples that you made to the `SimpleApp-Bazel` directory:

      ```shell
      % git -C ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ add .
      % git -C ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ reset --hard HEAD
      ```

      You're also about to specify a custom backup directory so, to avoid confusion, delete the previously-created backup directory:

      ```shell
      % rm -r ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel-BACKUP/
      ```

      The local `~/demoapps` working tree should now be clean. You can confirm by checking its git status:

      ```shell
      % git -C ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel/ status
      On branch main
      nothing to commit, working tree clean
      ```

      We've discarded the `productscience.yaml` file, so we'll need to re-copy it to the workspace directory:

      ```shell
      % cp ~/Downloads/productscience.yaml ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel

      % ls -go ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel
      ...
      -rw-r--r--  1    819 May 11 2023 WORKSPACE
      -rw-r--r--  1   3619 May 12 2023 productscience.yaml
      ...
      ```

      Let's run `PSCliCodeInjector` on the SimpleApp-Bazel workspace again, but this time we'll save the backup directory to the `/tmp` directory. Let's also rename the backup directory to something a bit shorter (`SimpleAppBackup`). Your new `backup-directory` will be `/tmp/SimpleAppBackup`, and your new `PSCliCodeInjector` command will be:

      ```shell
      % PSCliCodeInjector ~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel \
          --console-build-command "bazel build //ios-app:SimpleApp --ios_multi_cpus=arm64" \
          --backup-dir /tmp/SimpleAppBackup
      ```

      Run this command and wait for the tool to finish its work. When done, the changes should *almost* match those that you saw after finishing the previous examples. The only difference will be that `~/demoapps/iOS/SimpleApp-Bazel-BACKUP/` no longer shows up in that directory's `git status`. Instead, you can find the backup directory at `/tmp/SimpleAppBackup`:

      ```shell
      % ls -go /tmp/SimpleAppBackup/
      total 16
      -rw-r--r--  1   819 May 16 19:50 WORKSPACE
      ...
      ```

### Changing the configuration archive path _(offline-compatible builds only)_

_NOTE: This option is only relevant if your build environment does not allow network access. Standard builds will load this information automatically from our API._

```shell
PSCliCodeInjector <root-directory> \
  --console-build-command "<console-build-command>" \
  --local-config <config-archive>
```

By default, PSCliCodeInjector expects your configuration archive to be named 'productscience.zip', and to be placed in your project's root directory.

If you'd prefer to keep the archive somewhere else, you can tell PSCliCodeInjector where to look by passing the archive's full path (including name) to the `--local-config` option.

### Other options

`PSCliCodeInjector` accepts several other options. Pass the `--help` flag to see the full list:

```shell
PSCliCodeInjector --help
```
