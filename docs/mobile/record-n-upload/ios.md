# iOS Trace Recording

## Record

### 1. Install instrumented app

- Install the app you [instrumented in the previous steps](../integration/ios/distribution.md#ios-application-distribution-instructions). 
- Make sure it is instrumented

### 2. Select a user flow you want to analyze

At Product Science, performance optimization starts with defining key user flows that bring the most value to users.

##### What is a user flow?

There are several ways to select a user flow:

- [**Preferred**] __An "Action-Reaction" one-step flow__. 
  Here, the user starts with an "Action" (pressing a button, swiping, selecting a menu item, etc.) 
  and you measure until a "Reaction" (new page being fully displayed, etc.). 
  These flows are clean and simple to analyze.
- __More complex flows__. Sometimes, there are multiple steps that need to be strung together to get an idea of 
  the performance of a feature. 
  It can make sense to have flows like these, but consider carefully if they can be broken down into smaller parts.

Either way, a sequence of functions execute before the user finally arrives at the final state ("Reaction"). 
This is where our AI technology comes into play—highlighting the sequences that formed into what 
we call __execution paths__.

**Note: User flows should be short in length, 30 seconds or less, to enable the analysis to be a manageable size.**

### 3. Trace and screen recording

You can start trace recording from the instrumented app itself. 
If you want to capture app start, you can kick off trace recording from PS Companion app.

## Upload

There are two ways to upload a trace file and video to PS Tool, via web or via the PS Companion app. 

### 4. Upload your trace and video to PS Tool via web

- To transfer traces from your phone to your computer, use AirDrop or any file sharing method of your choice
- Go to PS Tool https://productscience.app/ on your computer
- Select or create a user flow folder for the analysis
- Open the user flow folder and click on Add trace in the top right corner of the screen 
- Once your trace is uploaded, open it and go to the the Annotations screen
- From the Annotations screen, click Upload video and select the video file

### 5. Upload your trace and video to PS Tool via the PS Companion app

- Tap the 'Export' button to export your trace file.

![export-icon](../../images/export-icon.png)

- Choose PS Companion app among sharing options:

![share-companion-app](../../images/share-companion-app.png)

[Don't see PS Companion app? Customize the share sheet.](../device-set-up/ios.md#3-customize-share-sheet)

- Name the trace, and add it to the corresponding user flow folder
#### Attach screen recording
- On the same screen, while the trace details screen is still opened, tap 'Select'

- Phone library opens &gt; select the screen recording

![name-trace-ios](../../images/name-trace.png){ width="300" }


- Once the trace and video finish uploading and processing, you can view your trace in PS Tool. 
  The uploaded trace will appear in your productscience.app User Flow Library.
