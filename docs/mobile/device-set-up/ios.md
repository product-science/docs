To record a trace, let’s first get you set up.

These preparatory steps only need to be once.


## 1. Install [PS Companion app](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ps-companion-app/id1634153033)

You will use PS Companion app later to upload traces and screen recordings to PS Tool.
Additionally, when recording app start, PS Companion app will be the place to start trace recording.
